AI Cooking Assistant

Final Group Capstone as part of the MTECH Mobile Development Course.

First off, this app is far from finished. But it is completely functional in this state. Most of our remaining work pertains to the UI and the security surrounding the API.

I mostly worked on the base functionality of the app. To put it simply, I made the buttons do the things. I made the speech synthesizer, voice recognizer, and their respective settings, handling a lot of bugs when it came to such. I also helped out in the UI where I could.
