Blackjack

My solo capstone project as part of the MTECH Mobile Development course. 

This is made in SwiftUI (which isn't my strongsuit.) Its main purpose is to be a blackjack simulator. And making the blackjack game was definitely the highlight of it. It was made incredibly difficult thanks to the API calls, but I eventually got a solid game of blackjack going where the app could not only determine if you win, but also what your best course of action is based on basic strategy.
